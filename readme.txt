Assign a different theme to individual pages/posts, as well as a different page layout (template) for each!

== Description ==
(See screenshots below)

Sometimes, you have a WordPress site that your client wants to have a particular page or post use the layout from a completely different theme. Getting different themes to work alongside one another and not cause conflicts can be very frustrating! That's why we design this plugin. It makes it easy to assign a different theme and layout to pages and posts on a per-page basis.

Simply create a new page or post as you normally would. Then, from the meta box menu "WXY Advanced Multitheme" you can change the theme layout used for this page/post by selecting a different them from the drop-down menu.

If you change your mind and want that content to be displayed using the default theme of your site, no problem! Just unselect the theme and it is now switched back to your original theme!

We also understand that compatibility is critical. That's why every effort was made to ensure compatibility with third party themes and theme building plugins.

However, since no one can test every possible combination of WordPress setups, we have also included a handy way to tell WXY Advanced Multitheme to ignore any troublesome plugins when it is serving up content using an alternate theme. Just check the box, and it no longer gets loaded unless you are using a page/post that uses the default theme for your site.

If you want to turn all pages back to the default theme at once, simply turn off the WXY Advanced Multitheme plugin!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who needs this plugin? =

People who need to support more than one theme on different pages/posts without trying to create a WordPress multisite environment with multiple domains.

= The page/post that I assigned an alternate theme to is not working correctly. =

Sign in to your WordPress admin area and go to Settings > WXY Advanced Multitheme > Blacklist to change these settings.

= There is some strange layout code now appearing in my page/post. =

WXY Advanced Multitheme does not alter the html or content of your page in any way. However, many third-party themes and theme builders do use theme-specific special codes for a lot of page elements like video containers, tables, columns, etc. The only way for this code to be supported is to use an alternative theme that supports it.
